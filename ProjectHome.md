A half finished tower defense game with block towers shooting at block enemies. It is a project I used to learn XNA, but ultimately lost interest in, so I stuffed it full of Xml documentation and providing it here as an example of how not to do it. Maybe someone will be able to learn something from it.

I'm not especially familiar with licenses, so I'm not sure I picked the correct one. What I want is: Feel free to do with it what you want. If you end up using parts or even the whole of the project somewhere, a mention and link to my website (www.spoonforge.com) would be nice, but isn't strictly required.
